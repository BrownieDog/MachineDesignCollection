# Welcome to the Machine Design Collection of Super Cool Code!
Please dust off your shoes and enjoy your stay.
# What is this?
This is where we dump all our code and anything else we want to share in real time
# Where should I put my stuff?
Anywhere. We started with folders for everyone's stuff just in case we named files the same thing, but now we should be fine to work anywhere. 
# What do I do if something breaks?
Don't panic! Git offers plenty of ways to solve these kinds of problems. In your IDE, use the merge conflict manager to identify how your code is different than what it thinks it should be, then accept changes until it works. As a backup, you can ctrl+A ctrl+C your code and pop it somewhere else while you try to resolve conflits. Then, when you're done, you can copy the parts that didn't survive the merge back into your code. Alternatively, use google or text me.
# Are we going to get a good grade?
I sure hope so bud
